This tool takes into account the air resistance of an object.
If it wasn't for the aerodynamic drag, the object would have linear acceleration, which is not the case.

Enter height, mass and shape of an object and this tool will provide

- how long the object will fall
- what the maximum speed of the object will be
- at what point the maximum speed will be reached
- a table with precise values for every moment of the flight
- a graph to visualize speed, acceleration, height, max speed and force of the object


## Usage

Feel free to fork this project for your own studies.

If you improve this tool in any way a pull request would be very much appreciated ✌️
